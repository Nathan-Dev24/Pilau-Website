	<h2 class="head">ABOUT US? <br>HAVE YOU BEEN WONDERING, WHERE DID PILAU CAME FROM? NOW WORRIES ASIDE. LET'S EXPLORE...</h2><hr>
	<div class="about-paragraphs">
	<p>Pilau is associated with the people of the Kenyan coast, and I must admit, they make the meanest pilau but we are slowly catching up :. There are many variations to the recipe but today I will give you my take. You cannot have a Kenyan food blog without the most cherished Kenyan recipe!</p>
 <p>Pilau likely originated in Ancient Persia, but Kenyans, and residents of many other lands – India, Pakistan and most Middle East countries, claim that Pilau originated with them. Westerners know it as Rice Pilaf.The children at Mawewa School crave the dish and students in Class 4 wrote about it:</p>
 <p><i>“Pilau is also a balanced meal. It contains the three food groups.”</i></p>
 <p><i>“Every Saturday my mother cooks Pilau. I also know how to cook Pilau. Sometimes when my mother is too tired, I help prepare the meal.”</i></p>
 <p><i>“I find Pilau very sweet. After eating it I feel I full but still want to have some more.”</i></p>
 <p>Natasha, goes a step further and provides cooking directions:</p>
 <p><i>“When preparing Pilau you put oil first, then onion, then cover it, then put kitunguu saumu (garlic), then wait for a little while before you add Pilau masala – a mixture of spices. You then add meat, water and cover it. After it boils, you will then add rice.”</i></p>
 <p>We have included a recipe for Pilau Masala that you might like to try. This version is based on a recipe by author, Nathan Museve.<i><b>Swee<span>Tie</span> Pilau Recipe</b</p></i>
